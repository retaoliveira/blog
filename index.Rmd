I am currently an associate professor at the Federal Center for Technological Education of Minas Gerais, where I have been teaching applied geography to Social Sciences, transportation geography, urban analytics, data analysis for management, and urban logistics courses since 2006. After concluding my doctorate in Geography in 2016, I have been involved in research projects focusing on geocomputation to implement spatial analysis methods to characterize, explain and assess urban and regional planning, city logistics solutions, and accessibility-oriented planning.

Some of the research projects I have worked in concern: 

+ the development of trip generation models regarding the logistics facilities in the Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Region; 

+ warehousing location in Belo Horizonte and São Paulo Metropolitan Area, concerning morphological and functional aspects of the city; 

+ the analysis of temporal and spatial changes regarding the distribution of logistics facilities in metropolitan areas; 

+ spatial modeling of urban freight transport in middle-sized cities and historical cities; assessment of potential locations for a pickup points network in Belo Horizonte; 

+ and accessibility-oriented planning to promote equity considering the access to urban functions and the morphological structure of the cities. 

I have just concluded a post-doctoral research with the City Logistics Chair and under the orientation of Prof. Dr. Laetitia Dablanc. My role as a postdoctoral researcher concerned investigating warehouses' location changes in different metropolitan areas and their relationship with the urban structure and real estate market practices.

I'm also a researcher at the PLACES - PLanning for ACcESs research group with a focus on accessibility oriented planning, Urban Freight Transportation and applied spatial analysis. I'm a member of the Network on Intelligent Urban Mobility and Accessibility Research (NIUMAR) and of the Network for Organizational Studies, Society and Subjectivity (NOSS).
